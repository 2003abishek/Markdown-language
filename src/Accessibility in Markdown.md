# Accessibility in Markdown

Markdown supports accessibility best practices by allowing the use of semantic HTML elements:

- **Headings**: Properly use `#` to `######` to create a clear document structure.
- **Links**: Use descriptive link text.
- **Images**: Include informative alt text.

By following these practices, your Markdown documents can be more accessible to everyone.
