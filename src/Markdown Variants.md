# Markdown Variants

There are several Markdown variants that add extra features:

- **CommonMark**: A strict Markdown specification.
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)**: Adds features used on GitHub, like task lists and tables.
- **MultiMarkdown**: Extends Markdown with additional syntax for footnotes, citations, and more.
