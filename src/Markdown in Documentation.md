# Markdown in Documentation

Markdown is widely used for writing documentation due to its simplicity and readability. It is used in projects like:

- **Read the Docs**: Hosts documentation written in Markdown.
- **Docusaurus**: A static site generator for documentation.
- **Sphinx**: Uses reStructuredText and can convert Markdown with extensions.
